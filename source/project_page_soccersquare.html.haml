				Soccer Square is a managerial game about soccer, which takes place on Facebook, among Facebook users. The player embodies a coach of a football team: she will choose the best training strategy for her players, the best game strategy with respect to her opponent, make the wisest buyout decisions in the football market and the smartest investments, to win the championships.
			%p.project-description
				Your Facebook friends could be your best allies and the most formidable opponents at the same time! You can find them on the other side of the soccer pitch, and challenge them after having meticulously studied their game strategy – you can exult on their Facebook wall after a winning match, or you can enroll them as personal coach assistants, accountants – to better supervise investment decisions – or hospital nurse to accelerate healing times of your players injured during previous matches.
			%p.project-description
				Easy, immersive and extremely challenging at the same time!
				On Soccer Square – with a hyper-immersive interface – you will be guided through the first steps of the experience of being a coach: as soon as you get accustomed with rules, rhythms, action and events, you will be able to successfully drive your own team both through championships and friendly games. With Soccer Square you have plenty of opportunities to win, gain and to scale up your proficiency level toward an always more challenging experience!
			%p.project-description
				Soccer Square is the only managerial game about soccer where things happen almost for real! As soon as the time goes on, even if you don’t actively participate, your team will play and end up tired anyway; the grass of your soccer pitch will fade off or grow too much; the floor of the locker room will get dirty and the mood of you team will slow down. You are the coach and they need you! This also means that if you can’t play for a while, you can always come back: maybe your players have missed you a lot, but they are still bravely hard-earning their position on the A-rankings!
