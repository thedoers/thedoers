        Tacatì conveys a traditional product through an innovative experience. Once again, innovation is attached to service and to user experience.
      %p.project-description
        The product is locally-sourced grocery. Mainly food, but also cleaners, articles for personal and body care etc.
        Community supported agriculture (c.s.a.), indeed, is not a new thing. The traditional c.s.a. service though have few rigidities, which Tacatì translates into opportunities and an innovative service model.
      %p.project-description
        Rigidity n.1 – offer: lack of flexibility with the variety of products and the quantity you can order. Usually c.a. boxes are made of a fixed quantity of goods (usually family-sized), whose composition varies according to the season and the availability of the single producer that source them.
      %p.project-description
        Rigidity n.2 – lifestyle: lack of flexibility with the delivery times and places. Boxes are delivered at working times for the producer and for you as well, typically at your place or in gathering places that are difficult to reach. Unless you don’t work at home/you can easily leave you office for a while, it’s quite difficult to catch the box and the user experience become a nightmare.
      %p.project-description
        Rigidity n.3 – prices: lack of flexibility in the selection and the substitution of producer or in adding a new one, which also implies a very limited competition and a sort of monopoly which tend to keep prices at the upper side of the market.
      %p.project-description
        Tacatì gathers local producers ( = whose production site is less than 100km away from your place) and conveys their offers into a single web shop: you browse the offer, fill your e-cart with the exact quantities that fit your specific weekly needs, choose a delivery place – it can be your place, your office or a gathering point nearby -, pay with your credit card and wait for the box!
      %p.project-description
        Deliveries happen once per week. Prices are much lower than the corresponding product at the supermarket (while quality is higher!) and gathering places can be user generated: if you have a refrigerator too big for your personal/family/business needs, you can offer your place/office/shop to host some of Tacati deliveries and get a percentage of the shipping price!
      %p.project-description
        Last but not least, Tacatì has a federal architecture: if you feel like selecting and organizing a network of local producers around your city and set-up a similar service for your fellow citizens, you can contact Giulia and Stefano and borrow their web platform (and experience!!) to start a new, sustainable and smart business adventure! Tacati is always in search for partners!
