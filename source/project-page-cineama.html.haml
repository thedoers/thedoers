        Movies are the third most discussed topic on the web, in Italy and worldwide, and among the top 10 of conversation topics off line: we talk about cinema with friends, colleagues, to break the ice, to impress, to see similarities. Talking about movies people love and fight a million of times every day. This immense and uninterrupted conversation is the essence of cinema.
        Cineama take this essence and puts it back in its place: at the center of the film production and distribution processes, as the main agent and engine of the supply chain.

        What does Cineama offer?
        Cineama you would like to offer young screenwriters and directors a chance to see their work professionally carried out, as long as quality is deliverable with less than € 250,000 – approximately.
      %p.project-description
        On the other hand Cineama wants to try out an alternative funding system to the legacy of the sector, giving everyone the chance to co-finance, through small but significant sums, their preferred movie.
      %p.project-description
        Finally, Cineama will enable every user to support the distribution of their beloved films or documentaries, on line or off line.
        How?
        Cineama subscribers can:
      %p.project-description.point
        meet other community members and talk about Cinema through the community wall or creating on purpose discussion groups;
      %p.project-description.point

      %p.project-description.point
