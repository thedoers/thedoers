      %p.project-description
        The integration of information and processes, throughout the product lifecycle and different tools (ex. CAD, PLM, PDM, ERP, MRP etc) – from concept to delivery – is traditionally file based, where info are archived and updated to a large extent manually.
      %p.project-description
        Such a promiscuity of tools and redundancy of man- ual operations results in a disproportionate number of time consuming and repetitive – though delicate – activities, which leads to inefficiencies at operational level and eventually lack of satisfaction for managers and executives.
      %p.project-description
        Weight Analytics solution provides high data con- sistency and transparency, standardization and automation of workflows, enhanced tools to support analysis and decisions making borrowed within best- in-class methods from the BA world, which have a tremendous impact on process and product quality.
      %p.project-description
        Weight Analytics is a product developed and distributed by Altair to big manufacturing clients.
      %p.project-description
