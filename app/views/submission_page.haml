					So you do have a Start-up! If you feel like we could be the right partners to help you understand whether your entrepreneurial idea is feasible or not, to improve what you already have and give you the right tools to reach a sustainable goal, then get in touch and tell us your story. Even if you have no team, just you and your temper, we value people and ideas first!

					As a starting point we have created an application form to guide you through the main information we would like to have about you and your start-up. This will help us have a clear idea about your project since the beginning, allowing us to weight your start-up and meet you already with the right information in mind.
				%p.submit-description
					Please fill out all the fields, we will carefully go through it and contact you for an informal meeting. Don't worry! We won't disclose the information you are sending us, it's in our professional interest to keep things confidential.

					Let's say you took your time to fill the application form, you send it to us and we learned everything we need to know about you, coming to the conclusion that we would love to meet you, your team and your idea. What about a lunch together at our studio? You share your project, we'd really love to share with you our office made food, experience, and advice while considering the next step to take.
